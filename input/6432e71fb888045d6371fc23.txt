## Job Description

Stardust is powering the Metaverse, an interconnected world of blockchain and
NFT enabled games.

We're building the future of gaming - and we don't say that lightly. Think of
us as the foundation for Metaverse economies connecting games, finance, the
future of work, fashion and more. The infrastructure for Ready Player One if
you will. We're developing backend technology to power new gamer-first
economies.

As a SaaS, blockchain agnostic, platform – we offer a seamless “low code”
integration of NFTs for game studios; and looking for players who think big,
build bigger, and want to turn crazy ideas into reality.

Are you ready to play?
