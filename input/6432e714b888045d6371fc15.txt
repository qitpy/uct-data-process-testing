## Job Description

Metaschool is looking for a Graphic Designer to turn ideas and verbiage into
visually engaging, marketable communication for our current and potential dev
audience.

There are 30M developers in the world but only 24k devs are actively
contributing to the web3 ecosystem as of now. Blockchain and protocol
companies need more devs in web3 to survive and thrive. Metaschool helps these
companies by building fun, free and exciting projects for web2 devs to propel
to web3. Find this exciting? Keep reading.

Working at Metaschool

Metaschool produces courses for devs to build, ship and learn web3. We have
over 70K devs signed up from 50+ countries within 5 months of launch.

Weâ€™re a decentralized, remote-first company with teammates based in Singapore,
India and Pakistan (for now ðŸ˜‰). We are divided by borders but our common
mission to help devs build and flourish in the web3 ecosystem has brought us
very close. If you are in any timezone of Asia and are a web3 native, we would
love to have you onboard.

Our Values

  * Buidl dope shit! - We care about what you have built, not your degrees or FAANG experience.

  * Stay weird - Own yourself, be yourself! Diversity is our strength! 

  * Improve daily - Daily efforts compound. Donâ€™t underestimate them.

  * Developers come first - We are building for devs. Put them first, always!

  * Learners for life - Leave your ego outside, learn whenever you can.

  * Collaborate to win - If you want to go far, collaborate and go with a team.

The Role

Weâ€™ve tried hiring for this role multiple times, like on 5 separate occasions.
Till now our team member Sinwan, who doesnâ€™t have a degree in design, has been
creating designs for us but sheâ€™s got other stuff to do and would really like
someone to come in and completely manage this role. Youâ€™ll be in charge of
setting up the entire design function (cuz we donâ€™t have one yet) and create
some of the most bomb creatives for Metaschool. Our audience engages with us
on Discord, blogs, emails & socials and for that we need some cool creative
material coming in regularly. Moreover, weâ€™ve got NFTs to give out every month
- and for that we need someone who comes with fresh design ideas and delivers
them.

Our Graphic Designer can possibly:

  * Participate in the creative ideation process, lead in bringing new ideas to the table and offering a fresh perspective on pre-existing themes & concepts

  * Work with the marketing team to build effective, direct-response ads that cater to various user personas on different platforms & take initiative to understand how individual creatives perform and if they are impacting metrics, learn from it and adjust accordingly

  * Have knowledge of the web3 space and what visuals + themes are trending in order to take inspiration and incorporate them into our designs 

  * Create the dopest and memorable NFTs that tie in with the Metaschool brand and keep devs coming back for more

  * Organize monthly creative calendars with relevant team members, as well as be able to (sometimes) accommodate short notice requests

YOU:

  * Be the coolest, raddest designer out there, even if not on paper

  * Have a clear understanding of the web3 space

  * Be a solid communicator and take feedback like a boss

  * Ideate, draft and create the coolest set of icons, graphics, illustrations known to the web3 space (hey, no pressure!!)

  * Own the process and function from start to finish

  * Be a learner at heart and stay updated on all the newest design concepts and developments making it online

  * Know and have considerable experience in Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator and (bonus) Figma!

  * Bonus: know your way around motion graphics or willing to learn!

If any of the above doesnâ€™t apply to you and you still strongly feel you can
do it. Donâ€™t let us stop you.. Apply for the opportunity.

Perks

At Metaschool, you will have exposure to product, business, growth, technology
and everything in between. Additionally, you will get:

  * Competitive Salary

  * Generous Equity

  * Health Insurance 

  * Paid Time off

  * Macbook + Workstation Allowance

  * Multiple Tech subscription(s) to make your life easier

  * And an amazing bunch of weird frens!!

We are so excited to see you around. Please reach out to us and weâ€™d be happy
to speak to you.
