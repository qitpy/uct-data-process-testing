## Job Description

We are looking for an ambitious and self-driven engineer who can help support
and grow a thriving community of developers. This is an opportunity to pave
novel ground in crypto, pursuing an uncharted path for smart contract
platforms and building a highly secure and decentralized settlement layer for
blockchain-based systems.

You will play a critical role in realizing the ambitions of a transformational
Layer 1 blockchain, ensuring that the internet remains permissionless,
ownerless and for the empowerment of all.

Youâ€™ll lower the learning curve for others entering our ecosystem, becoming an
expert guide for developers journeying through. You can work with software
that is under active development and figure things out so others won't have
to. We don't expect someone to know everything, but to start from a strong
foundation, take initiative and grow.

**What you'll do:**

  * Take ownership of the onboarding experience, ensuring the appropriate resources are available and widely circulated in the developer community
  * Proactively identify issues and potential solutions that drive developer adoption, facilitate an ever-improving onboarding experience
  * Engage directly with ecosystem projects on technical support on Discord or forums, assist in debugging, showcase best technical practices
  * Work alongside community and marketing personnel to grow and nurture the ecosystem
  * Travel to conferences, hackathons and other crypto community events to grow and support the ecosystem
  * Create and improve technical content: documentation, explainers, examples
  * Maintain understanding of technologies across the industry to accurately compare and contrast the technology we create with others

**Who you are:**

  * 1-3 years in the crypto industry, 5+ years of engineering/development experience
  * Demonstrated experience building or supporting decentralized applications, knowledge of how communities/ecosystems form
  * Understanding of blockchain architectures and considerations such as UTXO/Account model, Solidity vs. Move, EVM vs. CosmWASM, Solana vs. Sui/Aptos, basic working knowledge of cryptography
  * Comfortable operating in a space of constant evolution, that at times can be uncertain or contradictory
  * Highly proficient in Rust and TypeScript, bonus if proficient in C, Go, or Solidity
  * Strong communication and relationship management skills, responsive and well-organized
  * Open Source experience is a big plus
  * Computer Science or Computer Engineering degree, but self-taught developers are welcome to apply
  * Fluent in both English and Chinese

**What we offer:**

  * A globally distributed work environment with a high degree of autonomy, agency and flexibility
  * Small team of passionate individuals, the opportunity to build something truly novel and game-changing
  * Collaborative, fast-paced, self-initiating culture
  * Competitive salary
