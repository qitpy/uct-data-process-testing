## Job Description

 **About The Role**

As part of the Blockchain Research team, you will be working closely with the
engineering team to bridge between state-of-the-art research and cutting edge
technology. The scope, as it currently stands, is open-ended, but some
projects will likely be from the following areas: networking, consensus,
incentives, authenticated storage, zero-knowledge proof systems, anonymous
payments, smart-contracts, scalability and performance. The vision is to
initiate and drive projects that are motivated by advancing Aptos and
blockchain technology in general and publish worthwhile results in top tier
conferences, as opposed to working on publishable results and then trying to
find applications to blockchains.
